My name is Niti. I'm interested in Data Science, Computer Vision and Art.  
I like creating cool stuff related to these fields.  
  
The cover image above is "The Persistence of Memory" by Salvador Dalí, dude was just trying to paint what he saw in his weird dream.  
I thought it would be cool to use it so that people think there's some deep about me.
