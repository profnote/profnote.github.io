My name is Niti. I'm interested in Data Science, Computer Vision and Art.  
I like creating cool stuff related to these fields.  
  
This picture is called "The Persistence of Memory" by Salvador Dalí.  
While it looks deep, he was just simply painting what he saw in his weird dream.  
It reminds me not to overthink things.
