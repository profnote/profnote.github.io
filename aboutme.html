I enjoy writing software for personal use or research. Recently, I developed a great passion for applying data science to art (my other hobby).

I grew up in Thailand, but also spent about 4.5 years in Boston during my childhood. After returning to Thailand, I enrolled in bilingual schools ever since.
I have a great interest in science, especially biology, which lead me to qualifying for the Japanese Government Scholarship after highschool. I then realized how I liked the
data analysis part of research rather than doing repetitive experiments in the lab. So now I'm pursuing a career in data science in the USA!
