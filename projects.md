## C3.ai COVID-19 Grand Challenge
[**Analysis of COVID-19 Policies' Impact on the Population and the Economy**](https://github.com/Island-Hamstar/code-submission)  
*3rd Place - $12,500 Prize Money*  
Proposed a new method for quantifying impact of government issued policies on trends of new COVID-19 cases, mobility, and stock market prices.

## Deep Learning and Computer Vision
[**Complexity Estimation of Deep Learning Models**](https://github.com/profnote/ml-performance-prediction)  
*Data Science Practicum Project – CCC Information Services*  
Created a tool for estimating the training time of deep neural networks given its structure, input data shape, and GPU specifications.  

[**Color Scheme Analysis of Popular Illustrations**](https://github.com/profnote/ColorHarmony)  
Analyzed color usage trends of popular illustrations from Pixiv. Created a tool that extracts color palettes from an image, trim out relatively less vibrant colors, and identify the color harmonies.  

[**Automatic Image Colorization**](https://github.com/profnote/NeuralNetworks-AutoColorization)  
Trained a convolutional neural network that implements image classification as global priors to produce more accurate automatic colorization of grayscale images.  

## Algorithmic Trading
[**Algorithmic Trading – Order flow**](https://github.com/profnote/AlgoTrading-PriceImpactOrderFlow)  
Implemented medium frequency trading strategy with a running window based on order flow impact on micro-prices.  

[**Algorithmic Trading – Pairs Trading**](https://github.com/profnote/AlgoTrading-PairsTrading)  
Implemented basic Pairs Trading strategy with a running window over 30 assets based on collinearity of asset prices and computed target exit prices based on expected holding time.  

## Machine Learning
[**MLB Playoffs Prediction**](https://github.com/profnote/MLB_Playoffs_Prediction)  
Trained a binary classification model to predict each MLB playoff match results using regular season team performance as predictors.
