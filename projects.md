## Complexity Estimation of Deep Learning Models
#### Data Science Practicum Project – CCC Information Services
Created a tool for estimating the training time of deep neural networks given its structure, input data shape, and GPU specifications. 

## Color Scheme Analysis of Popular Illustrations
Analyzed color usage trends of popular illustrations from Pixiv. Created a tool that extracts color palettes from an image, trim out relatively less vibrant colors, and identify the color harmonies.

## Automatic Image Colorization 
Trained a convolutional neural network that implements image classification as global priors to produce more accurate automatic colorization of grayscale images.

## Algorithmic Trading – Pairs Trading
Implemented basic Pairs Trading strategy with a running window over 30 assets based on collinearity of asset prices and computed target exit prices based on expected holding time.

## MLB Playoffs Prediction
Trained a binary classification model to predict each MLB playoff match results using regular season team performance as predictors.
